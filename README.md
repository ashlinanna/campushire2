### Project Description
CampusHire2 is a web-based job portal that connects college students with local employers for part-time job opportunities. It allows students to browse and apply for jobs, while employers can post jobs and manage applications through a dashboard.

### The Problem Statement
Many students struggle to find trusted part-time job opportunities near their college campus. At the same time, local businesses find it difficult to reach verified student workers.

### The Solution
CampusHire2 bridges this gap by creating a centralized platform where:
- Students can view and apply for jobs.
- Employers can post and manage job listings.
- Application status can be tracked in real-time.
